                    <h4>Pivot BME: Machine Learning-Enhanced Blood Pressure Monitor</h4>
                    <p>Hypertension affects one-third of the global population, yet optimizing treatment remains challenging due to limitations in home blood pressure monitoring accuracy. This gap contributes significantly to preventable mortality, accounting for 10 million deaths yearly. Emerging from the translational research environment of the JC STEM Lab of Smart City, Pivot BME is developing a pioneering ultra-accurate home-use blood pressure monitor with the integration of machine learning. The device would enhance home blood pressure measurement accuracy by three to fifteen times compared to existing models. By addressing the accuracy gap in the current market, patients and healthcare providers can make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and a significant reduction in preventable deaths.</p>

                    <h4>Parkinson's Disease-Caused Abnormal Driving Behavior Detection</h4>
                    <p>Parkinson's Disease (PD) can significantly impair a person’s ability to drive safely due to motor symptoms such as tremors, slowed reaction time, and rigidity, which collectively increase the risk of traffic accidents and affect the overall safety of public transportation. This research aims to address this issue by developing an early-warning system that detects abnormal driving behaviors linked to PD symptoms, thus enhancing road safety. Additionally, the project seeks to implement continuous in-car health state monitoring, enabling real-time assessment of a driver’s health status and potentially preventing dangerous situations.</p>
